                <p> Welcome to the Department of Electronics and Communication, better known, J. K. Institute of Applied Physics and Technology at the University of Allahabad. J. K. Institute of Applied Physics and Technology stands as one of the most prestigious education centers of our country. It is a Department of Electronics and Communication, located in the Muir College Campus (Science Faculty) of the University of Allahabad-which is one of the four oldest universities 
                    in India. Foundation stone of the J.K. Institute was laid by Late Pt. Jawaharlal Nehru on
                     January 14, 1949, and it was formally inaugurated by him on April 4, 1956. It was named as J.K. Institute as
                      J.K. charitable Trust contributed for the construction of the complete building structure. It is a pioneer Department in the country for teaching and research in the discipline of Electronics and Communication. The people who initially associated in growing up of the department were Prof. Krishnaji and the first head of the Department and well-known figure Prof. S. N. Ghosh – followed by Prof. M.S. Bisht, Prof K.D. Dikshit, and Prof V. Malviya and their colleagues.
                    The Department conducts courses in the fields of Electronics & Communication and Computer Science. These courses have 
                    been designed to meet the current challenging demands of the nation. The Computer Science discipline was started in the 
                    year 1986 through the DRDO project on the ‘Man Power development in the area of Computer Science’. The Department offers 
                    B.Sc (Computer Science), M.Sc (Computer Science), B.Tech (Electronics and Communication Engineering), B.Tech (Computer Science 
                    and Engineering), M.Tech (Electronic Engineering), M.Tech (Computer Technology) and D.Phil program. In a span of nearly 60 years,
                     the alumni of the Department have made a significant contribution in their fields in India and abroad. The alumni of the Department
